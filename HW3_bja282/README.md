To complete this assignment, I followed the steps below: 

1. I met in a work group with fellow classmates Sofiya Elyukin, Jonathan Geis, Sebastian Gutierrez, Fernando Fernandez and Scott Smith to 
go over the assignments. We decided on a Null Hypothesis together for Problem 2. 
2. I also met with Jonathan and Scott on Monday evening to work on Problem 2 together. 
3. I completed Problem 2 using resources like StackExchange to explore how to index, re-index, and ascertain the day and hour of 
the "starttime" field in the Citibike data, which I stored in a Pandas dataframe. I added two columns to the dataframe that marked rides at given start times as beginning and ending
within the MTA's definition of Rush Hours and then added a third column assigning a value of "1" to rides during rush hours and "0" to those
taking place in Off Peak Hours. I then graphed the results on a day-by-day basis using Professor Bianco's examples as the basis
for my work. 
4. After completing Problem 2, I began working on Problem 1. During our group call, we reviewed methods for approaching and completing the assignment. We went over the elements and clauses to compute each of the distributions. I used Scott and Sebastian's notebooks as 
assistance and reference when building and completing my own. 
5. For Problem 3, I used Professor Bianco's class slides as a basis to approach the problem. I imported the time table from her github into a dataframe and then calculated the mean, standard deviation and sample size. After, I plugged the resulting numbers into the z-test formula to return a final value.
